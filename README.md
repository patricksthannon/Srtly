This simple AppleScript-based Mac Os App helps you automatically organize files in your chosen folder (like Downloads or Desktop) into neat, categorized subfolders — such as Images, Videos, Audio, Documents, Compressed Archives, Codes & Scripts, Folders(existing folders), and Other.

<sub>  *Mac OS may block apps downloaded from the internet because they are not signed or notarized. Completely normal, as I didnt want to pay $99 apple developer fee to verify the app so its likely to occur :| </sub>

<sub>To open this app safely:</sub>

<sub>1. Download and unzip the app as usual. </sub>

<sub>2. Right-click (or Control-click) the app icon in Finder.</sub>

<sub>3. You’ll see a warning dialog about the app being from an unidentified developer. Click Open again to confirm.</sub>
